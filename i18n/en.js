<p>On the left side is the central navigation. Here you can switch between the feeds you have subscribed to, as well as launch other actions.</p>\

",
  page_firststeps_2:"Discover feeds in the library:\
<p>The library is grouped by categories and a small part of the feeds available on this server.</p>\
<p>If you like a feed, just click on \"Subbscribe\" to add it to your subscriptions.</p>\
",

<p>With the function \"OPML-Import\" you can quickly import OPML files from Google Reader, Feedly and other compatible RSS readers.</p>\
<p>Choose the file from your computer and start the import by clicking on \"Start import\".</p>\
<p>All valid feeds in the OPML will be added to your subscriptions.</p>\
<p>In the \"Status\" column you can see the import status of the feeds.</p>\
<p>The most common errors \"Server problem\" and \"Invalid XML\" can not be fixed by us, because they're caused by the feed source.</p>\

<p>Just paste the URL of the feed (if known) or the URL of the website (e.g. \"spiegel.de\") and click on \"Discover feeds\".</p>\

<p>The display option \"Jump to the top upon opening a feed item\" determines, if the top of a feed item you open will jump to the window top (so you can read as much as possible at once) or if it is \
supposed to stay at the position where you opened it.</p>\
",
  page_firststeps_6:"Feed view:\
<p>In the feed view the items available in a feed are shown.</p>\
<p>You can open items by clicking on them.</p>\
<p>Items marked in bold are currently marked unread; as soon as you open them, they'll automatically be marked read.</p>\
<p>\"Reload\" will get the newest items from the servers; \"Reload from source\" forces a full update from the feed source.</p>\
<p>You can mark individual items as unread by clicking on the \"Mark as read\" button and share them with your Twitter followers and Facebook friends by clicking on \"Share\".</p>\
<p>You can customize the text for Twitter and Facebook posts before publishing.</p>\
<p>If you have a Premium account, certain feeds will appear in full text. This is a premium feature because some feed publishers choose to offer only an excerpt of the content and loading \
and storage of the full content is a very time- and memory-intensive effort.</p>\
<p>If you have a Premium account and would like to read a feed in full text, please write us an e-mail and we will take care of it.</p>\
